## üìú Description

CVE-2024-6387_Check is a lightweight, efficient tool designed to identify servers running vulnerable versions of OpenSSH, specifically targeting the recently discovered `regreSSHion` vulnerability (CVE-2024-6387). This script facilitates rapid scanning of multiple IP addresses, domain names, and CIDR network ranges to detect potential vulnerabilities and ensure your infrastructure is secure.

## üåü Features

- **Rapid Scanning**: Quickly scan multiple IP addresses, domain names, and CIDR ranges for the CVE-2024-6387 vulnerability.
- **Banner Retrieval**: Efficiently retrieves SSH banners without authentication.
- **Grace Time Detection**: Optionally detect if servers have mitigated vulnerabilities using the LoginGraceTime setting.
- **IPv6 Support**: Fully supports IPv6 addresses for both direct and hostname-based scanning.
- **Multi-threading**: Uses threading for concurrent checks, significantly reducing scan times.
- **Detailed Output**: Provides clear, emoji-coded output summarizing scan results.
- **Port Check**: Identifies closed ports and provides a summary of non-responsive hosts.
- **Patched Versions Detection**: Recognizes and excludes known patched versions from vulnerability reports.

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py <targets> [--port PORT] [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--list FILE] [--grace-time-check [SECONDS]]
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `<targets>`: IP addresses, domain names, file paths containing IP addresses, or CIDR network ranges.
- `--port PORT`: Specify the port number to check (default: 22).
- `--timeout TIMEOUT`: Set connection timeout in seconds (default: 1 second).
- `--list FILE`: File containing a list of IP addresses to check.
- `--grace-time-check [SECONDS]`: Time in seconds to wait after identifying the version to check for `LoginGraceTime` mitigation (default: 120 seconds).

### Examples

#### Single IP

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py 192.168.1.1
```

#### IPs from a file

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py -l ip_list.txt
```

#### Multiple IPs and Domains

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py 192.168.1.1 example.com 192.168.1.2
```

#### CIDR Range

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py 192.168.1.0/24
```

#### With Custom Port

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py 192.168.1.1 example.com --port 2222
```

#### Checking LoginGraceTime Mitigation

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py 192.168.1.1 --grace-time-check
```

#### Checking LoginGraceTime Mitigation with Custom Time

```bash
python CVE-2024-6387_Check.py 192.168.1.1 --grace-time-check 150
```

### ‚ú® Features Explained

#### Grace Time Detection

The tool supports checking for [LoginGraceTime mitigation](https://www.cynet.com/blog/regresshion-cve-2024-6387/). When the --grace-time-check option is used, the script will wait for the specified duration after retrieving the SSH banner to see if the connection remains open, which indicates that the LoginGraceTime setting might be set to 0 as a mitigation measure.

#### IPv6 Support

The tool fully supports IPv6 addresses. You can scan both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses directly or through hostname resolution.

#### Patched Versions Detection

The tool recognizes certain patched versions of OpenSSH and excludes them from the vulnerability report, ensuring more accurate results.

### Output

The script will provide a summary of the scanned targets:

* üö® Vulnerable: Servers running a vulnerable version of OpenSSH.
* üõ°Ô∏è Not Vulnerable: Servers running a non-vulnerable version of OpenSSH.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown: Servers running an unknown version of SSH
* üîí Closed Ports: Count of servers with port 22 (or specified port) closed.
* üìä Total Scanned: Total number of targets scanned.
